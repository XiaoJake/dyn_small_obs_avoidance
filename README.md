# Avoiding dynamic small obstacles with onboard sensing and computating on aerial robots

This repository is used for UAV dynamic small obstacles avoidance. It is a complete system for lidar-based UAV, including FAST-LIO slam, time-accumulated KD-Tree mapping and kinodynamic A* search modules. It is able to avoid dynamic small obstacles (down to 20mm diameter bars) by running at 50Hz.
